  abstract      = {{The fluorescent indicator adsorption (FIA) method is the most commonly used industry method for the determination of total aromatics in light fuels. Alternative methods using supercritical fluid chromatography coupled with flame ionization detection (SFC—FID) have been proposed. Quantitative studies are performed on aromatics in jet and diesel fuel, using standard blends derived from gasoline, jet, and diesel fuels to determine the accuracy of SFC methods. The goal is to develop a simple method for use in a rapid, automated routine. To this end, a single column, one mobile phase under constant density, and no temperature programming or valve switching is used.}},

has been separated by supercritical fluid chromatography on a packed silica column.
The retention times were primarily dependent on the number of double bonds and the
chain length of the parent acid had a negligible influence. The efficiency and resolution
of cis- and trans-isomers of C18 and C22 esters were examined on linked columns
from 25 to 175 cm overall length. Improvements were obtained up to 125 cm but the
effects were limited by increases in the back pressure.},
